# IPL-Score-Prediction
IPL score prediction using Random Forest Regressor and Hyper-Parameters Tuning.

# Introduction
Aim of this project is to build a model which will predict the final score of an IPL match with the help of certain ML techniques.

# Motivation
In the midst of this pandemic, the IPL has kelp us entertained and hooked onto our seats.
I myself is an avid fan of IPL cricket and the sport. So I decided to try my hands on a dataset to predict the scores of the matches.

# Project Flow

1) Data Analysis - Finding out Different relations.

2) Feature Engineering - Processing the data before it feeding to the model.

3) Model Building using ML - Using ML/Dl Algorithms.

4) Model Building using Auto ML.
